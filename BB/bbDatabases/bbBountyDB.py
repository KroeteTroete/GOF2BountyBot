class bbBountyDB:
    """A database of bbObject.bounties.bbBounty. Bounty criminal names and faction names must be unique within the database. Faction names are case sensitive.
    
    . . .
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    bounties : dict
        Dictionary of faction name to list of bounties
    factions : list
        List of str faction names, to be used in self.bounties keys
    maxBountiesPerFaction : int
        Maximum number of bounties that can be contained in each bounty's list in self.bounties[faction]
    latestBounty : bbObjects.bounties.bbBounty.Bounty
        The most recent bounty to be added to this db.
        As of writing, this is only used when scaling new bounty delays by the most recent length

    Methods
    -------
    addFaction(faction)
        Add a new useable faction name to the DB
    removeFaction(faction)
        Remove a faction name from this DB
    clearBounties(faction=None)
        Clear all bounties stored under a faction, or under all factions if none is specified
    getFactions()
        Get the list of useable faction names for this DB
    factionExists(faction)
        Decide whether a given faction name is useable in this DB
    getFactionBounties(faction)
        Get a list of all bbBounty objects stored under a given faction.
    getFactionNumBounties(faction)
        Get the number of bounties stored by a faction.
    getBounty(name, faction=None)
        Get the bbBounty object for a given bbCriminal name or alias.
        This process is much more efficient when given the faction that the criminal is wanted by.
    canMakeBounty()
        Check whether this DB has space for more bounties
    factionCanMakeBounty(faction)
        Check whether a faction has space for more bounties
    bountyNameExists(name, faction=None)
        Check whether a criminal with the given name or alias exists in the DB.
        The process is much more efficient if the faction where the bbCriminal should reside is known.
    bountyObjExists(bounty)
        Check whether a given bbBounty object exists in the DB.
        Existence is checked by the bbBounty __eq__ method, which is currently object equality (i.e physical memory address equality)
    addBounty(bounty)
        Add a given bbBounty object to the database.
        Bounties cannot be added if the bounty.faction does not have space for more bunties.
        Bounties cannot be added if the object or name already exists in the database.
    removeBountyName(name, faction=None)
        Find the bbBounty associated with the given bbCriminal name or alias, and remove it from the database.
        This process is much more efficient if the faction under which the bounty is wanted is given.
    removeBountyObj(bounty)
        Remove a given bbBounty object from the database.
    toDict()
        Serialise the bbBountyDB and all of its bbBounties into dictionary format.
    hasBounties(faction=None)
        Check whether the given faction has any bounties stored, or if ANY faction has bounties stored if none is given.
    __str__()
        Return summarising info about this bbBoutyDB in string format.
        Currently only the number of factions in the DB.
